Simple Linear Regression

This repository contains a straightforward implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the basics of linear regression, including:

Understanding the relationship between a single independent variable (X) and a dependent variable (Y)

Fitting a linear model to data

Making predictions based on the fitted model

Evaluating model performance using common metrics

The code is beginner-friendly and designed to help you grasp the fundamental concepts of linear regression without any complex libraries.
